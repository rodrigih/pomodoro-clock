# Pomodoro Clock

This is a Pomodoro Clock created in React. This project was created so that I can practice React and JS
in general.

Here is a live [demo](https://rodrigih.github.io/pomodoro-clock/)

If you want to run this on your own machine, perform the following steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rodrigih/pomodoro-clock.git
$ cd pomodoro-clock
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
